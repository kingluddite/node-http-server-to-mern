# Seed data
* We add a JSON file with product data
* We add a populate.js with data
* We connect to the database

## Testing
* We use `$ node populate.js`
* That should give us a success message that we connected to our mongo remote db
* No data seeded yet
* Test if you comment out dotenv line that you get an error
