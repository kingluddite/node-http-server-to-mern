# HTTP Server
* Just a simple HTTP server with some routes

## Contents
* Basic HTTP node server
* jQuery
* including headers and footers (TODO: Update with new code)
* routes 3 pages
* TODO: figure out how to serve static files

## Instructions
`$ npm run dev`

* That will run nodemon on this host `http://localhost:3000`
* That home route `/` serves an html page using Bootstrap 4, fontawesome (5) some custom css and bootstrap 4 javascript using jQuery.

## TODO
* I want to add serving static assets like images and local JavaScript

## Next Branch: Express
* Convert from node's native http module to using Express
